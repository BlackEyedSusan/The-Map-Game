# The-Map-Game
Tips:
location_id is the same thing as the territory id
the __init__ function of the classes declare attributes of that class upon creation
the __init__.py files can be left alone, I can handle what goes in there
the del keyword deletes objects (which can be used to delete military units upon death)
the default map stats holds what the map should be by default, right now it creates all of the objects (territories in this case)
make sure you don't cut other code off from working
